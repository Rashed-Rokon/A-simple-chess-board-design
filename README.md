# A-simple-chess-board-design

In this project, I have desinged a simple chess boad using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

What Did I learn:

I have used loop and conditionals to design the board. I have used 'addclass' JavaScript command for the first time here.

Challanges:

As I followed this exercise from Scrimba, after I copied the code in Visual Studio code, My chessboard design did not work in browser. After spending a while , I noticed that it woroks if I put the JavaScript tag right before the body ended, not in the HTML head like the person did in the exercise. So I have changed the position of the JS tag before the end of the body from head.
